Certainly! However, I must note that my last training cut-off in September 2021

*	Create a function that accepts a string as an attribute and can sort data by ` name ` attribute. 
*	The sort should accept string ` ascend or descend ` and sort countries name by provided attribute (e.g., providing attribute ascend all countries should be sorted from A to Z) . Use this Json as input payload:   [{
        "name": {
            "common": "Uzbekistan",
            "official": "Republic of Uzbekistan",
            "nativeName": {
                "rus": {
                    "official": "Республика Узбекистан",
                    "common": "Узбекистан"
                },
                "uzb": {
                    "official": "O'zbekiston Respublikasi",
                    "common": "O‘zbekiston"
                }
            }
        }
    },
    {
        "name": {
            "common": "Ubbekistan",
            "official": "Republic of Uzbekistan",
            "nativeName": {
                "rus": {
                    "official": "Республика Узбекистан",
                    "common": "Узбекистан"
                },
                "uzb": {
                    "official": "O'zbekiston Respublikasi",
                    "common": "O‘zbekiston"
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ]

Certainly! To achieve this in MuleSoft's DataWeave (DW), you can create a custom function. Here's how you might set up such a function using the provided JSON:

Define the DW function:
You'll define a function named sortCountries that takes two parameters: the array of countries and the sort order (ascend or descend).

Implement the sorting logic:
Inside this function, you'll use the orderBy function to sort the array based on the name.common attribute of each country. Depending on the sort order provided, you'll either sort in ascending or descending order.

Here's the DataWeave script for this:

dw
Copy code
%dw 2.0
output application/json

fun sortCountries(countriesArray, sortOrder) =
    countriesArray orderBy ((country) -> 
        if (sortOrder == "ascend") 
            country.name.common 
        else 
            country.name.common * -1
    )

---
sortCountries(payload, "ascend")
In the above DW script:

The orderBy function sorts the countries based on the name.common attribute.
The ternary operation checks the sortOrder. If it's "ascend", we use the common name directly for sorting in ascending order. If it's "descend", we multiply the name by -1 (this is a simple trick to reverse the string's order for sorting).
When you pass the provided JSON as the payload and run the script, you should get the countries sorted by their common name in ascending order (because we've hardcoded "ascend" for now).

To change the sorting order, replace "ascend" in the sortCountries invocation with "descend".

Note: This is a basic example and may not handle all edge cases, such as if the common name has the same value for multiple countries. Adjustments might be necessary based on the specific requirements of your application.

"country.name.common * -1 " not working and throw an error. Fix it
ChatGPT
Apologies for the confusion. You're right; multiplying a string by -1 isn't valid in DataWeave. My mistake.

Let's fix the sorting function:

To handle the ascending and descending order for strings, you can modify the ordering logic within the orderBy function. Here's a corrected approach:

dw
Copy code
%dw 2.0
output application/json

fun sortCountries(countriesArray, sortOrder) =
    countriesArray orderBy ((country) -> 
        if (sortOrder == "ascend") 
            country.name.common 
        else 
            country.name.common) descending (sortOrder == "descend")

---
sortCountries(payload, "ascend")
In this corrected version:

The orderBy function sorts the countries based on the name.common attribute.
The descending function is used to handle the descending sort, and it checks whether sortOrder is "descend". If it is, then it sorts in descending order, else it sorts in ascending order.
This should handle the sorting as per your requirements.

descending function throw error "

OUTPUT
Unable to resolve reference of: `descending`."
ChatGPT
I apologize for the oversight. You're correct, there's no descending function in DataWeave. My apologies for the confusion.

A correct way to handle the sorting in ascending and descending order in DataWeave based on the sortOrder would be:

dw
Copy code
%dw 2.0
output application/json

fun sortCountries(countriesArray, sortOrder) =
    if (sortOrder == "ascend") 
        countriesArray orderBy $.name.common 
    else 
        countriesArray orderBy $!name.common

---
sortCountries(payload, "ascend")
In the orderBy function:

$ refers to the current item.
$.name.common sorts by the common name in ascending order.
$!name.common sorts by the common name in descending order.
You can change the "ascend" in the sortCountries invocation to "descend" to get the descending order.
